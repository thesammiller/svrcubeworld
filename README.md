# Oculus Mobile SDK Cloud XR Server 

TODO:
- Need to check the license for GLFW
- Need to check the license for LearnOpenGL
- Need to check the license for Oculus Mobile SDK


NOTES:
- Clear Color in Oculus SDK is unclear -- uses either SurfaceRendererAppl or Appl
- GlGeometry opens up a whole can of worms... What do I really need from there?
