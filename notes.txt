# Graphics Pipeline

Two major parts:
1) Convert 3D coords to 2D coords
2) Convert 2D coords to actual color pixels

Graphics Pipeline taks as
Input SET OF 3D COORDINATES
Output COLORED 2D PIXELS

Pipeline divided into several steps
Each step takes the previous output as input
Highly specialized (each has one specific cuntion)
Can easily be executed in parallel

GPUs run SHADERS in parallel (shader is a small program for each step)

OpenGL Shading Language

INPUT 3D DATA --
1) Vertex Shader
2) Shape Assembly
3) Geometry Shader
4) Test and Blending
5) Fragment Shader
6) Rasterization

Primitives --> points, triangles, lines

A FRAGMENT is all the data required to render a single pixel

Required to define at least a VERTEX and FRAGMENT shader

2D --> Z coordinate of 0 (depth remains the same, looking 2d)

Once coords have been processed, NORMALIZED DEVICE COORDS
X, Y, Z, in range -1.0 -- 1.0
Anything outside will be clipped
0,0 is center of screen
-1, 1 is top left
1, -1 is bottom right

will be transformed to SCREEN SPACE COORDINATES via the VIEWPORT TRANSFORM using data
from the glViewport

With vertex data, we need to send it as input to the vertex shader
This is done with a VERTEX BUFFER OBJECT (VBO)
Send large batches of data all at once
Sending data from CPU to GPU is slow, so want to send as much as possible at once
has a unique ID corresponding to the buffer
